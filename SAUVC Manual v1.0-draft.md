### Design to compete. Destined to explore.

### 1. Introduction
Singapore AUV challenge was first conducted in year 2013 with the aim of raising awareness about marine science & technology and growing the marine robotics and related community in Singapore. Over the years, the challenge has witnessed exponential growth in terms of reach and number of participants. We had 6 teams in year 2013, that has grown to around 60 teams who registered for the challenge in year 2019.

While the core committee of people who started the event has largely remained the same, the size of the committee has also grown form 2013 to date. Additionally, the various functions that needs managing has also grown. The knowledge of how to go about the various aspects of organizing SAUVC, has been passed from one committee to another, year after year.

As with all growing teams/organizations, especially one that comprises entirely of volunteers, being able to work independently in an agile fashion, is a key factor. In order to achieve this, we need to have a common repository of the knowledge that has accumulated over the years. This is the intent of this manual.

This manual is meant as a guide to various aspects of SAUVC such as:
- Structure of the SAUVC committee
- Roles and responsibilities of each of the sub-committees/members
- General timeline from the formation of a new committee leading all the way to the event and the post-event debrief meeting
- Recommended timeline for the major activities. E.g. announcement of the event, closing of registration etc.

### 2. Committee structure
While the actual event comprises of 3-4 days of activities (typically over a weekend), it is the culmination of a year's worth of planning and background work.

A recommended list of roles required for the SAUVC committee over the duration of the entire year is as follows:
- Chair
- Vice-chair
- Treasurer
- Secretary
- Outreach
- Logistics
- Sponsorship
- Publicity
- Technical
- Webmaster

As stated, this is not an exhaustive list of roles for the committee. Each year's committee is free to decide which roles are deemed necessary for the committee (E.g. Co-chair).

While the above list captures most of the major roles required throughout the year leading up to an event, some other roles (individual or team) are required mainly during the event, such as:
- Game master
- Judges
- Emcee(s)
- Slot manager(s)
- Trolley manger(s)
- Safety officer(s)
- Registration and/or payment-management team
- Certificate printing team
- Audio-visual/presentation preparation
- WiFi management
- Food catering/distribution
- Diving
- Media/UW photography/team interviews team etc.

This list is completely up to the committee to decide closer to the event, depending on the number of participants, venue etc. This document will focus more on the first list and provide guidelines for populating the second list closer to the event.
